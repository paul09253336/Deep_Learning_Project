In this project, I used ECG signals to detection sleep apnea events.
Because some reason, I can't release data.

Traning and vaildaton accuracy can reach 98% and 97%.
In test part, I use Apnea-ECG dataset and UCDDB dataset.

cnnlstm.py is my deep learning architecture code
Apnea_train2.py is the training file
